# CACert CA root certificate Installer

This addon adds the CACert root certificate to the Firefox trusted root store.

You can also use [certutil](https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/tools/certutil.html#1034010) to add root certificates to Firefox.

## Todo

Would be nice to also add the [CACert Revocation List](http://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/BrowserClients#Installing_the_CRL). I was not able to find out how to do this.
