# CACert CA root certificate Installer

This addon adds the CACert root certificate to the Firefox trusted root store.

You can also use [certutil](https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/tools/certutil.html#1034010) to add root certificates to Firefox.

## Author

I did not write this. [Nico Haase](https://www.nicohaase.de/2012/04/14/distributing-individual-root-certificates-for-firefox.htm) did. I removed the DFN certificates he ships, and changed the maximum Firefox version it is compatible with.
